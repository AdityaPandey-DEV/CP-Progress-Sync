## 🧭 Navigation

### By Difficulty
- [Easy Problems](easy/) - Fundamental DSA problems suitable for beginners
- [Medium Problems](medium/) - Intermediate level problems requiring optimization
- [Hard Problems](hard/) - Advanced problems with complex algorithms

---

## 📋 File Naming Convention

Files are named using the LeetCode problem slug/identifier:

**Format:** `{problem-slug}.{ext}`

**Examples:**
- `two-sum.cpp` / `two-sum.py`
- `longest-substring-without-repeating-characters.cpp`
- `merge-intervals.cpp`

Each problem solution file contains:
- Problem description (as comment header)
- Algorithm approach
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Solution code

## 🚀 Usage

### Running Solutions

**C++:**
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 {problem-name}.cpp -o solution
./solution
```

**Python:**
```bash
python {problem-name}.py
```

### Organizing Problems

To automatically sort problems by difficulty, run:
```bash
python scripts/sort_leetcode_by_difficulty.py
```

This script uses the LeetCode CLI to fetch difficulty levels and organizes files accordingly.
